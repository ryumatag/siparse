# Based on https://github.com/BurntSushi/jiff/tree/master/scripts/release.
# You'll need Bash, Cargo, jq, Git, and a configured Git signing key.
#
# I usually follow these steps when making a release. I start with a clean
# working tree and use a separate branch for the version bump:
#
#   git switch main
#   git pull --ff-only
#   git switch -c release/0.2.1
#   scripts/release/commit 0.2.1
#   git push -u origin release/0.2.1
#
# I then open a PR and merge it into main. Once it's merged, I update my
# local main and push the signed release tag:
#
#   git switch main
#   git pull --ff-only
#   scripts/release/publish
#
# commit runs the tests and cargo publish --dry-run before making the release
# commit. publish creates a signed version tag and pushes it to origin, where
# the publish workflow handles crates.io authentication and upload.
# You can also use update-version to prepare the version change yourself.
# If a check fails after the version bump, fix it and finish the commit by
# hand. The changes stay in your working tree.

# Find the repository from this script so the commands work from any directory.
